<h1>Hello I’m Madison and I’m <i>Single</i> </h1>
Stats:
<ul>
<li>21 years old</li>
<li>Woman (she/her)</li>
<li>Average height for women worldwide (5’4”)</li>
<li>Studying econ and mathematics with the hopes of becoming a PhD economist</li>
<li>If I wasn’t doing that, I would probably study rhetoric and technical communication.</li>
<li>Has played viola for 9ish years</li>
<li>Graduating in May ‘22!</li>
<li>Democratic socialist</li>
<li>Speaks Hebrew at the level of a clever toddler</li>
<li>Only-child but not with the weird complexes that come with that</li>
</ul>
Likes:
<ul>
<li>Walking long distances, biking, running short distances. I like to be active, but won't pretend to be particularly atheletic.</li>
<li>Cooking and baking. I've been working in kitchens intermittently for the past 3 years (one of which being a Shawarma restaurant) so I am rather skilled and enjoy studying different cultural cuisines.
Also I’m vegetarian! My favorite thing to make right now happens to be samosas but I also just eat a lot of peanut butter right out of the jar.</li>
<li>Reading and writing (particularly poetry). I compete in literary competitions occasionally but mostly I just write for me. I have a very quintessential male-manipulator taste in literature but at least I’m self-aware, you know?</li>
<li>Cryptograms and cyphers lmao. I just really like solving them and I’ve been very invested in watching the process of solving the Zodiac killer’s cyphers. I think quarantine is getting to me bc I’ve picked up chess again too and I started playing the crossword.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Extra perks:
<ul>
<li>Cute little southern accent</li>
<li>Parents love me</li>
<li>Union member </li>
<li>Nice tits</li>
</ul>
<br>
Why did I make this? I think it's funny! Ripped the idea from a friend’s website and anyway I’m kind of a put-myself-out-there ballsy person by nature, so this is pretty par-for-the-course.
<br>

If you’re a hiring manager or admissions dean who’s reading this, I’m so sorry! Please take this as a sample of my charisma and good-nature!

Best,
