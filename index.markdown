<li>Cooking and baking! I worked in an Israeli restaurant for a while so I make some mean falafel. Oh also I’m vegetarian. Favorite thing to make rn happens to be samosas but I also just eat a lot of peanut butter right out the jar</li>

<li>Cryptograms and cyphers lmao. I just really like solving them and I’ve been very invested in watching the process of solving the Zodiac killer’s cyphers. I think quarantine is getting to me bc I’ve picked up chess again too and I started playing the crossword.</li>

Why did I make this? I think it's funny! Ripped the idea from a friend’s website and anyway I’m kind of a put-myself-out-there ballsy person by nature, so this is pretty par-for-the-course.
